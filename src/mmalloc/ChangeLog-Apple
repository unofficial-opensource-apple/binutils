	* Makefile.in: add check-sup.c

	* mmprivate.h: add malloc, free, and realloc hooks to mmalloc
	pools, to better support a mmalloc pool that dispatches to system
	malloc with minimal intervention.  also add a "child" mmalloc, to
	support implementing mmcheckf by "chaining" a checking mmalloc
	pool on top of a lower-level implementation pool.

	* mmcheck.c: add abort() to the mmcheck and mmcheckf calls, to
	ensure they're not being used inadvertently (they will cause
	random memory corruption if they are)

	* mmap-sup.c: add mmalloc_endpoints, to support detecting the
	memory range used by a mmap-based mmalloc pool.

	* attach.c, mmap-sup.c: allow MMALLOC_SHARED or MMALLOC_PRIVATE to
	be used when opening a pool to determine the behavior used by
	mmap().

	* mmalloc.h: add declaration for mmalloc_endpoints, mmalloc_check_create.

	* mfree.c: use the new mfree_hook if present
	* mmalloc.c: use the new mmalloc_hook if present

	* malloc-sup.c: use the new mfree/mmalloc/mrealloc hooks to
	implement a mmalloc pool that simply dispatches to the system
	malloc.

	* check-sup.c: implement a "checked" malloc pool, using the child
	pool as the basis for allocating objects.
